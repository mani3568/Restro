Staff Management: Add, edit, and remove staff accounts. Assign roles and permissions.

Design Considerations:

Ensure the interface is user-friendly, with intuitive navigation and clear calls to action.
Use responsive design to ensure compatibility across devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).
Prioritize security features, especially for payment processing and customer data.
Incorporate branding elements (logo, color scheme) to maintain brand consistency.
Conduct usability testing to gather feedback and refine the interface based on user needs and preferences.
